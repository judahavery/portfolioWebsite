        <p>My first best work is not actually one of my best works, but it was a stepping stone to all my other work and achievements. My first midterm in CAWD was to build a short video game demo based around a shed theme. There were some bare requirements, but I enjoyed the project and asked if I could take it further. I decided to explore a lot of new features in the game engine Unreal Engine 4 and that led to my curiosity in game development.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The bare requirements consisted of building a first person game where you’re outside near a shed. This shed has three rotating tools as pickup items you can collect, and a light that will turn on and off. All of these interactions required a sound effect. I considered this project to be bland on its own and not really much of a game. I requested to make a side scrolling version of this as a small man walking along the shelves of a shed where the same requirements were met, but there would be some platforming involved. I wanted to take the project further and at least give it some fun.
        </p>
        <p>Working in Unreal Engine 4 for the first time is outright overwhelming. We were taught the basics, but anyone who chose the game development side of the midterm was more so on their own. The end product was definitely nothing special compared to what I can create now, but the effort I invested into that project helped teach myself to have a more individual and self reliant approach to my work ethic.

        <p>My second best work is by far what I am most proud of from a visual standpoint. The statewide SkillsUSA competition arrived where a team of two would build a video game from scratch. My partner Colton and I spend six months creating a prototype for a game idea we had. To confirm that I could succeed in the game industry, I really wanted to win this competition. My program focused on 3D animation and web design, not much game development, so I needed to get a lot help from my friend Google.

        <p>At the statewide ceremony Colton and I placed 1st and were proceeded to the national competition at the leadership conference in Louisville, Kentucky. We kept up the game’s production for another 3 months after the state competition and were prepared for nationals. After a week of meetings and presentations we discovered our team was awarded 7th place in the country. Colton and I were also both given certificates stating that we could work as professionals in the industry. Not only was this my overall best work, but it also gave me many new skills along with awards and certifications.

        <p>My third best work is still in development, but I know it will make the list. I am building another game prototype for the SkillsUSA game competition. We started development in early February on this product and it still has a way to go. This game uses different production tools for the 2D engine. I am using a new game engine, new programming language, and we are all using 2D instead of 3D art. I am not experienced in any of the new tools for 2D games and struggle sometimes, but it’s similar to last year. The one important difference is that now I am self sufficient. The past year of struggling for answers on new content helped me become self taught.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I chose to create a 2D game to challenge myself. I could enjoy the smooth process of working within comfortable territory on a 3D game with familiar tools, but that wasn’t enough. I didn’t just want to win the competition again, but wanted something out of process. If I repeated the same skills as last year, there would not be much of an reward. Working in new territory has expanded my horizons in game development. I am now proficient in the two major game engines used across the industry, two 3D modeling softwares, Python, Javascript, html, css, and C#. I do not have a single regret from switching game styles. Even if we don’t win, the experience we gained is well worth creating a game outside of our specialization.
