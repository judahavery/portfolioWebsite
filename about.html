        <hr>
        <p> My name's Judah Avery, I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at Champlain College expected to graduate in 2023.
        I'm extremely passionate about crafting unique worlds and experiences for others to enjoy.
        I found my passion during my third year of high school when I switched to a tech school.
        Through the Computer Animation and Web Design program I covered a lot of different territory.
        In the program, I worked on projects in web development, graphic design, animation, and game development.
        After my first attempt at a small game project, I became obsessed. All of my focus transitioned to
        learning programming, 3D art, and explored game engines.
        Outside of work, school, and my personal game development projects I like to spend my time outdoors.
        Whenever I have the opportunity, I'm hiking, skiing, snowboarding, or rock climbing.
