                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>Splatterpunk is a 2D puzzle-platformer set in a colorless, corporate city, where you play as Iggy
                    Blob, one of the slimes in this dystopian place desperately looking for a way out. The player is
                    tasked with escaping by using their ability to invert colors, affecting what they collide with in
                    the world. Our team of 7 created Splatterpunk over 3 sprints (weekly sprints) during spring in 2021
                    for a team-oriented game studio course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This course did not focus much on the game's overall quality but emphasized proper teamwork within
                    your discipline. I contributed to the project as a designer but worked across many other disciplines
                    as well. My experience with Unity allowed me to help with specific technical issues and gave the
                    programmers some leeway when they needed it. Thankfully I could also implement my own designs for
                    the UI, which saved a lot of time. I always enjoy helping in other roles when I can. It mixes up the
                    work and improves my communication with the people in that discipline. Looking back, Splatterpunk
                    was a great learning experience. Despite working with a large team and tight deadlines, we managed
                    to create something polished, so I’m happy with how it turned out.
                </p>

                <h4>Game Intent</h4>
                <p>Splatterpunk is a 2D puzzle-platformer that gives the player control over what colors they collide
                    with in the world around them. Players can invert their color to interact with certain buttons,
                    doors, and colored platforms to complete puzzles. We didn’t want the gameplay to rush the player,
                    which made the pacing much slower. But this ended up matching the somber themes of the game’s
                    setting that we later brainstormed about. Players needed to think carefully about the obstacles in
                    each level and then execute the correct platforming solution. In the end, the game’s pacing,
                    visuals, and the gameplay itself all meshed together pretty cohesively, especially for something
                    made in 3 weeks.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Design Process</h4>
                <p>In our very first conversation, the team agreed to make something small to allow room for polish on
                    such a short timeline. The class emphasized the importance of teamwork capabilities in a
                    professional studio environment, so we also wanted to ensure we used agile development effectively.
                    Our team also decided that whatever idea felt the most accomplishable, we would pursue. As long as
                    the game stood apart in some way from others in the genre, that would be enough. With these
                    guidelines set, we could focus our brainstorming on ideas for a short, quality game that we could
                    realistically create as an effective team. In the first sprint, we made rapid progress, and this was
                    for a few reasons. I’ll attribute most of the credit to our lead programmer, who didn’t waste any
                    time implementing nearly all the gameplay systems we needed in a few days. Both artists on the team
                    also drew some great concept art that fueled our inspiration for the game world, characters, and
                    setting. After that first week, we had already figured out the game’s visuals and implemented most
                    gameplay.
                </p>
                <img class="image-break" src="images/games/gifs/splatterpunk_2.gif"
                    alt="Splatterpunk Gameplay Screenshot">
                <p>
                    Thanks to this progress, the design process moved much quicker. The other designer and I could work
                    directly in-engine the moment our designs were ready for implementation. Instead of waiting to test
                    our designs, we could get feedback quickly. Our toolset of mechanics was already working in-game, so
                    we could repeatedly implement and revise designs. During the second sprint, we made more progress on
                    the art and design. Progress was moving fast, but the game required testing soon, and we didn’t have
                    any levels to play through yet. Our focus on building and polishing the systems shifted to creating
                    something playable. This meant creating menus, levels, tutorials, and anything that would be
                    required for players to open our game and play it without us instructing them. Despite how low in
                    scope we aimed, testing still snuck up on us, so we had to do it at the nearest opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of the final sprint, we tested and learned that players wanted to know more about the
                    story and found some bugs to fix. We were surprised by the lack of negative feedback on the gameplay
                    though. Most players seemed to enjoy gameplay a lot, which meant we were on the right track. As a
                    result of testing, one of our artists pitched the idea of displaying Iggy Blob’s progress on
                    escaping the city. We agreed this was a good idea, and added it to the game, but it was a very minor
                    incorporation of the story. Even so, we couldn’t afford to add more. Most of the final week was
                    spent purely on polish and ironing out the remaining bugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our last few days of development were very busy, but not too bad. The work was worth it.
                    Splatterpunk had plenty of polish, and we managed the scope along with our teamwork extremely well.
                    Throughout the project, we were in a constant state of revision. We often changed major aspects of
                    the game or adjusted our workflow drastically to solve any problems. I also learned a lot about
                    finding creative solutions to unusual problems on this project. Most of these problems were caused
                    by scope limitations, but many also involved our workflow. Looking back, I definitely left this
                    project with new and improved team skills, so I would consider Splatterpunk a super positive
                    experience.
