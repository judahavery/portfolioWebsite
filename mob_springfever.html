                    <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                    <p>Spring Fever is a short puzzle-game I created in under 5 days for the 2020 Unreal Spring Jam. The
                        theme for
                        the game jam was: “What Is Hidden In Snow Comes Forth In The Thaw.” I adapted this theme to a
                        puzzle game by
                        creating mechanics centered around the character and the level melting each time the player
                        moves. Spring
                        Fever takes place on a handful of floating islands where the player must move a snowman to a
                        flurry cloud
                        across the island to escape from the spring heat.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>The Time Constraint</h4>
                    <p>I came up with the rudimentary concept for Spring Fever fairly quickly after seeing the jam
                        theme. This
                        allowed me to get started on the main functionality of the game very early, using plain
                        geometric shapes as
                        placeholder elements. However, at that time all I could imagine was a block of ice trying to
                        reach some
                        arbitrary point in the level without melting. I had trouble coming up with an interesting
                        context for these
                        mechanics that was within the scope of 5 days. Originally, I wanted players to control an animal
                        that
                        thrived
                        in a cold environment but was stuck in a warmer region during the spring season. This would
                        require the
                        animal
                        to escape north for survival in a colder ecosystem, tying in with the theme perfectly and giving
                        players a
                        character they can feel empathetic towards. A snowman doesn’t exactly provide the same feeling
                        of empathy,
                        it's not something we recognize as a living creature.</p>
                    <img class="image-break" src="images/games/springFeverGameplay.jpg"
                        alt="Spring Fever Gameplay Screenshot">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>That animal concept still sounds more appealing to me than what I ended up with, but I didn’t
                        have the time
                        to implement such a complex character. This would involve creating a model with more complicated
                        parts and
                        would also require animations for leg movement. Realistically, if I wanted to have an animal in
                        the game I
                        would have to use a pre-made asset. I considered this but decided to find a different solution
                        because I
                        wanted to create as much as I possibly could by myself from scratch. Instead of using an animal,
                        I went with
                        the snowman. I got away with creating a single looping animation of the snowman slouching back
                        and
                        forth using a simple 3-bone rig. In the engine, I applied physics to the animations and bobbed
                        the snowman
                        backward when it moved to provide feedback to the player. In half a day I had the snowman
                        modeled, animated,
                        and implemented in the game. This was definitely a sacrifice I made but was also a vital
                        decision that
                        allowed
                        me to polish the game as much as I did. Without this thematic switch, I don't think Spring Fever
                        would feel
                        good to play or look nearly as visually appealing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Mini Postmortem</h4>
                    <p>The systems I created for Spring Fever have lots of variability in puzzle design but I feel that
                        I didn’t
                        get
                        to make use of them in the ways I intended. By the time the systems were fully working and
                        polished I had a
                        very limited amount of time to design, implement, and decorate levels. I ended up with only 6
                        levels, which
                        contained puzzles that were too easy and didn’t feel very rewarding to solve. Without the proper
                        time to
                        design puzzles with a strong “aha” moment, the game felt a bit lacking. Not to mention all the
                        other
                        mechanics
                        I had to cut out, for example, blocked passages would require keys to unlock. I had the idea of
                        freezing
                        items like keys or collectibles in ice blocks to create more steps to complete the level, making
                        it less of
                        a
                        straightforward path to the goal. However, yet again the time constraint didn’t allow for this
                        and I had to
                        stick with only the most fundamental mechanics of the game.</p>
                    <p>With such a low quantity of levels that were also fairly simple to solve, I wish I had spent less
                        time
                        polishing and more time designing fun and interesting puzzles. This would have made the game
                        feel much more
                        rewarding to play, but I’m still happy with the end product. It may not have won, but Spring
                        Fever did get
                        an
                        honorable mention in the game jam, putting it among the top 30 games of the total 276
                        submissions.</p>
