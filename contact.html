        <p class="spacedP"> While attending CTE I had the opportunity to compete in video game
        development for two years straight while also growing my academic portfolio.
        My partner and I were awarded first place
        at the state level competition two years in a row and last year we placed 7th on the national level.
        This summer we are returning to Lousville, Kentucky with CTE to compete on the national level again.
        Over the past two years I have amassed 18 college credits through
        dual enrollment courses either at CTE or attending the actual college for class.
        I was also enrolled in the Nation Technical Honors Society (NTHS) for both 11th and 12th grade.
