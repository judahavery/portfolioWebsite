        <h1 class="title">My Path Esssay</h1>
        <p>
        “Do you have any plans after high school?” I knew that I wanted to take a creative path, but there were too many options. In my first art class, harsh reality hit me. Blatantly put, I couldn’t compare myself to others because I thought they were all ten steps ahead of me. I needed a field where I could use my creativity, not some dead-end job, but nothing clicked. My ideal career seemed unrealistic, and all other careers sounded gray and bland. The thought of drudging through nine to five every weekday made me sick. I couldn’t live my entire life like that.
        </p>
        <p>
        About three quarters into the year, I had an opportunity to visit the Center for Technology, Essex. The school focused on industry-specific programs. I could get experience in multiple different creative industries prior to college in the next two years. That visit sealed the deal. I knew CTE would lead me down the most beneficial the path to my career.
        </p>
        <p>
        CTE eschewed the idea of standard traditional education. Instead, every day we worked on intriguing projects to help us learn. Our first game development assignment at the tech center revealed my ambition. We built a short rough game demo. Each night that week, though my eyes strained from the bright screen of my computer and my fingers cramped, still when the deadline arrived, I finished. As your little character ran along the shelves of a small shed, jumping over tools and birdhouses, you would collect three pick-up items to beat the level. For the first time in a while, I felt pride in my accomplishments. While I didn’t have a groundbreaking first project, my pride and passion would not disappear. The effort made me proud, not the quality or quantity. I wanted to take projects like my midterm to another level.
        </p>

        The statewide SkillsUSA competition arrived where a team of two would build a video game from scratch. To confirm that I could succeed in the game industry, I had to win this competition. My program focused on 3D animation and web design, not much game development. I needed to get help from my friend Google.
        </p>
        <p>
        My search history consisted of phrases like “How to rig a character,” “How to animate a walk cycle,” and “How to create a custom collision.” The morning before our presentation the butterflies in my stomach flew around uncontrollably. When I saw our game on the screen, pride took over, and I spoke confidently. After the presentation ended, the judge said, “Give it six months and you could publish this game.” That sentence is still engraved in my brain, and I never felt more proud. Afterward, we waited anxiously for the award ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the ceremony, I stared at the projector with a look of desperation for ten minutes as different awards were announced. When Interactive Application and Video Game Development appeared on the screen, my heart stopped. I froze and waited for our team name to appear. When I saw our names next to first place, the weight on my shoulders dropped. After three months, everything paid off.
        </p>

        The confidence I gained junior year helped me succeed, and I continue to improve my work. I’m taking the advanced CAWD (computer, animation, and web development) program in order to better prepare myself for the challenges and opportunities I’ll be facing. Now comparing myself to others has transformed that old intimidation into fuel. I have pride in my work and the effort behind it. Excitement fills my head as I focus on what comes next, learning about game design and its related elements. I’ve studied game development, programming, and animation. I know college programs are rigorous in this field, but I’m committed to giving my all. I’m up for the challenge.

        <h1 class="title">Community Service Reflection</h1>
        <p>
        Community service originally seemed like quite the daunting task. All I saw was a broken world with too many problems for a single human being to even make a dent in. That all changed when I started volunteering at our local church. Playing with children in the nursery, helping with the Sunday school lessons, and running the projection system weren’t things I was interested in, but there was a need and I stepped into it. Soon after, my older brother Jared and I found some other charities to volunteer with, including fundraisers, sleepouts, banquets for homeless youth, and packing meals with an organization called Feed My Starving Children.
        </p>
        <p>
        My favorite volunteer opportunity was participating in an event called the Penguin Plunge, which supported the Special Olympics. I fund raised door to door to raise awareness for the cause by jumping into a frozen Lake Champlain. Two years ago, I also started working as a paid caretaker for my younger brother Joshua. Josh was diagnosed with epilepsy, scoliosis, cognitive delay and autism at 5 months old. He’s 13 years old now and still not toilet trained. Needless to say, working with Josh has taught me a lot about being the kind of person whom others can rely and depend on.
        </p>

        During my time at CTE, I also participated in community service through the school. In my program, Computer Animation and Web Design 1 (CAWD), our whole class digitally repaired and refreshed old damaged photos for the elderly through Adobe Photoshop. The following year in CAWD 2, a few classmates and I explored across the school taking photos of all the service each program provided for the elderly to raise awareness of our Community Service Learning Days. My experience in community service is one I wouldn’t trade. I have been made more of aware of others’ needs, and how I can actually make a difference.
