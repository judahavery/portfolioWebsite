      <h4><strong>Project Overview</strong></h4>
      <p>NEO is a prototype for a Beat 'em Up game I created for a semester-long project. The goal of each level is a
        simple concept, players are dropped into a maze of rooms and tasked with finding the trophy which completes
        the level (in this case ends the prototype), but this Beat 'em Up has a very unconventional combat system. The
        gameplay and combat are driven by constant movement and evasion. The retro upbeat music and sound effects
        along with the neon aesthetic and VFX enforce this fast-paced, tense experience.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h4><strong>Game Intent</strong></h4>
      <p>NEO takes a lot of inspiration from top-down, fast-paced action games like Ape Out and Hotline Miami. Both
        games feel tense and stressful most of the time, but also feel immensely satisfying and rewarding to
        play. I wanted to create a similar experience, but add an interesting twist to the combat systems seen in
        "Beat 'em Up" or "Shoot 'em Up" games. To separate NEO from other games in the genre, I focused on designing
        the combat around the player's movement.
        In NEO, when the player uses their only form of attack (throwing their axe), they become instantly defenseless
        and must rely on avoiding danger with their evasive movement. This does not only add a twist to the combat
        mechanics but also puts more pressure on the player, supporting the intended experience.</p>

      <h4><strong>Designing The Intended Experience</strong></h4>
      <p>From the beginning, I knew I wanted to create a tense and fast-paced game with an emphasis on movement, but
        my original vision didn't quite achieve that experience. The old concept for NEO was fairly different from
        what you see now. I initially sought out to build an adventure game where the player could throw and swing a
        boomerang to attack the enemies within each level. The first prototype of the game's mechanics took place in a
        very large level with enemies spawning in fixed zones across the map. Turns out, the game just wasn't fun. The
        fast, evasive movement made the level feel way too large and open. Running from enemies and throwing the
        retrievable weapon at a distance to kill them felt too easy. It wasn't difficult OR tense enough, so I decided
        to re-work the level design and minute details to enforce feelings of intensity and fast-paced action.</p>
      <p>
        For starters, I shrunk the levels down to small, bite-sized rooms with multiple obstacles inside. On top of
        that, players couldn't leave this tiny room until all the enemies were defeated. This change added a cramped
        feeling which heavily contributed to make the game a more tense experience. These small rooms also
        incentivized players to constantly use their fast-paced movement. Additionally, instead of having endless
        combat, now players progressed by completing levels. Each level required the player to find and gain entry to
        the trophy room. The levels themselves were a grid of rooms that the player had to explore to find the trophy
        room, each new room being another risk at dying and restarting. </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to ensure players would feel some obligation to explore the level rather than go for a straight shot
        to the trophy room, so I implemented a scoring system. When you completed the level, your score would display
        and count up in front of you. To increase their score players had to kill enemies across different rooms,
        incentivizing them to clear as many rooms as possible before completing the level. The score added an element
        of risk versus reward, and in turn, made for more tense decision making. Players could take a chance by
        clearing more rooms for more points but would risk restarting the entire level when they die. I also added
        room drops. Whenever the player cleared a room, a random item would spawn in the center. This item could
        be a heart to heal the player, a bonus point pickup, or the trophy room key. This forced players to continue
        clearing rooms until the key dropped. Health would allow for more mistakes in combat, while bonus points added
        to their score, but as the player's score grew so did the consequences of dying. </p>
