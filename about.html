        <hr>
        <div class="about">
          <p>
            Growing up, I played a wide variety of games.
            Movies and tv shows didn't appeal to me, I didn't feel inevested in them. With games,
            I never watched stories and fantasies, I lived and experienced them.
            I became hooked from the very start for that reason.
            <br>
            <br>
            A lot of my time was also spent creating, rather than playing. Any game with some level editor tool I spent countless hours in, perfecting my "masterpieces."
            Whether these levels were made in games like Little Big Planet 2 or Halo Reach, I was ecstatic to watch my friends try them out.
            In games like Call of Duty, rather than honing my skills on the battlefield, I spent my time designing
            personal emblems in the editor. Even though I couldn't brag about my gameplay skills, I could show off my "flawless" designs.
            Which felt much more rewarding.
            <br>
            <br>
            In high school, I found my passion for game design. I had just switched to a tech school where I studied game development, animation, and web design.
            I booted up Unreal Engine 4 for the first time and became obsessed with it.
            I found the ultimate level editor, a game engine. After that, I poured all of my efforts into learning game development.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am currently attending Champlain College and expected to graduate in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Game Design. During my high school
            experience, I worked across the full spectrum of game development. I 3D modeled, rigged, animated, and programmed on the technical side
            along with designing the narrative, levels, and systems for my game projects. At Champlain College, I'm continuing to develop those skills,
            but I'm also working in larger teams on development projects learning more in depth how to manage workflow within a professional environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            Crafting unique worlds and experiences for others to enjoy excites me beyond explanation, and someday I hope to influence others with games
            the way I was impacted by them growing up.
