            <h4><strong>Project Overview</strong></h4>
            <p>NEO is a prototype for a Beat 'em Up game I created for a semester-long project. The goal of each level is a simple concept,
            players are dropped into a maze of rooms and tasked with finding the trophy which completes the level (in this case ends the prototype), but this
            Beat 'em Up has a very unconventional combat system. The gameplay and combat are driven by constant movement and evasion. The retro upbeat
            music and sound effects along with the neon aesthetic and VFX enforce this fast-paced, tense experience.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h4><strong>Game Intent</strong></h4>
            <p>NEO takes a lot of inspiration from top-down, fast-paced action games like Ape Out and Hotline Miami.
            Both games feel tense and stressful most of the time, but also feel immensely satisfying and rewarding to play.
            I wanted to create a similar experience, but add an interesting twist to the combat systems seen in "Beat 'em Up" or "Shoot 'em Up" games.
            To separate NEO from other games in the genre, I focused on designing the combat around the player's movement.
            In NEO, when the player uses their only form of attack (throwing their axe), they become instantly defenseless and must
            rely on avoiding danger with their evasive movement. This does not only add a twist to the combat mechanics but also
            puts more pressure on the player, supporting the intended experience.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>Designing The Intended Experience</strong></h4>
            <p>From the beginning, I knew I wanted to create a tense and fast-paced game with an emphasis on movement, but my original vision didn't quite
            achieve that experience. The old concept for NEO was fairly different from what you see now. I initially sought out to build an adventure
            game where the player could throw and swing a boomerang to attack the enemies within each level.
            The first prototype of the game's mechanics took place in a very large level with enemies spawning in fixed zones across the map.
            Turns out, the game just wasn't fun. The fast, evasive movement made the level feel way too large and open. Running from enemies
            and throwing the retrievable weapon at a distance to kill them felt too easy. It wasn't difficult OR tense enough, so
            I decided to re-work the level design and minute details to enforce feelings of intensity and fast-paced action.
            </p>
            <p>
            For starters, I shrunk the levels down to small, bite-sized rooms with multiple obstacles inside. On top of that, players couldn't
            leave this tiny room until all the enemies were defeated.
            This change added a cramped feeling which heavily contributed to make the game a more tense experience.
            These small rooms also incentivized players to constantly use their fast-paced movement.
            Additionally, instead of having endless combat, now players progressed by completing levels.
            Each level required the player to find and gain entry to the trophy room. The levels themselves
            were a grid of rooms that the player had to explore to find the trophy room, each new room being another risk at dying and restarting.
            </p>
            <p>
            I wanted to ensure players would feel
            some obligation to explore the level rather than go for a straight shot to the trophy room, so I implemented a scoring system.
            When you completed the level, your score would display and count up in front of you. To increase their score players had to kill enemies
            across different rooms, incentivizing them to clear as many rooms as possible before completing the level.
            The score added an element of risk versus reward, and in turn, made for more tense decision making. Players could take a chance by clearing more
            rooms for more points but would risk restarting the entire level when they die. I also added room drops.
            Whenever the player cleared a room, a random item would spawn in the center. This item could
            be a heart to heal the player, a bonus point pickup, or the trophy room key. This forced players to continue clearing rooms until the key dropped.
            Health would allow for more mistakes in combat, while bonus points added to their score, but as the player's score grew so did the consequences of dying.
